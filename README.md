# Fitness Tracker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This simple Fitness Tracker let's as user easily log and track their daily workouts.
I wrote the back-end (models, routes, and server) for this application as an assignment for the University of Washington's Full Stack Bootcamp, with simple front-end code provided for the assignment.
My desire to write a user-friendly application and explore the potential of mongoose and mongodb conflicts somewhat with the simplicity of the front-end: it should be noted that while a user is allowed to add multiple exercises to a workout by both the front-end and the database, doing so will currently break the graphs presented on the Dashboard page.

## Installation

The code can be run locally with npm. Simply download the repository, access the application's folder through the terminal, and enter npm start to access a local version of the application. A deployed version can be accessed at [https://boiling-anchorage-43870.herokuapp.com/](https://boiling-anchorage-43870.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

Create a workout using the New Workout button, which will prompt you to create an exercise. If you wish to add another, press Add Exercise, or press Complete to save your workout. The Continue Workout button allows you to add additional exercises even after returning to the main page. The Dashboard page allows you to view statistics for the week so far.

## Tests

A seed data file is contained in the seeders folder, allowing you to create a test data set to observe the application functioning as intended. Again, please note that the Dashboard page's intended behavior is only observable if only one exercise is added per day.
